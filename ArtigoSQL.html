        SQL or Structured Query Language is a critical tool for data professionals. It is undoubtedly the most important
        language for getting a job in the field of data analysis or data sciences.
        Millions of data points are being generated every minute and raw data does not have any story to tell. After all
        this data gets stored in databases and professionals use SQL to extract this data for further analysis.
    </p>

    <p class="Text_In">In this blog post, we will cover what is SQL and how does it work. SQL is fairly simple, thanks
        to easy syntaxes of this language. Let’s dig into understanding this Structured Query Language by asking this
        simple question.</p>
    <p class="Text_WhatSQL">What is SQL And How Does it Work?</p>
    <p class="Text_SQL_Data">SQL is the most common language for extracting and organising data that is stored in a
        relational database. A database is a table that consists of rows and columns. SQL is the language of databases.
        It facilitates retrieving specific information from databases that are further used for analysis. Even when the
        analysis is being done on another platform like Python or R, SQL would be needed to extract the data that you
        need from a company’s database.</p>
    <p class="Text_SQL_Manages">SQL manages a large amount of data, especially if there is a lot of data that is being
        written simultaneously and there are too many data transactions.
        There are different versions and frameworks for SQL, the most commonly used is MySQL. MySQL is an open-source
        solution that helps facilitate SQL’s role in managing back-end data for web applications. Companies such as
        Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. all use SQL for back-end data storage and data processing solutions. When an
        SQL query is written & run (or parsed), it is processed by a query optimiser. The query reaches SQL server,
        where it compiles in three phases; Parsing, Binding and Optimisation.
    <ul class="Text_SQL_Manages_ul">
        <br>
        <li><strong> Parsing</strong> – A process to check the syntax</li>
        <li><strong>Binding </strong> – A process to check the query semantics</li>
        <li><strong>Optimisation </strong> – A process to generate the query execution plan</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="Text_SQL_Manages">
        In the third step, all possible permutations and combinations are generated to find the most effective query
        execution plan in a reasonable time. The shorter the query takes, the better it is.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p class="What_SQL_Used">What is SQL Used for?</p>

    <p class="What_Used_Text">Now that we understand what is SQL and how does it work, let’s try to see what SQL can do.
        This programming
        language has various uses for data analysts & data science professionals. It is particularly helpful because it
        can:

    <ul class="What_Used_Text_ul">
        <br>
        <li>Execute queries against a database</li>
        <li>Retrieve data from a database</li>
        <li>Insert records into a database</li>
        <li>Update records in a database</li>
        <li>Delete records from a database</li>
        <li>Create new databases, or new tables in a database</li>
        <li>Create stored procedures & views in a database</li>
        <li>Set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>
        <li>Create new databases, or new tables in a database</li>
        <br>
    </ul>


    <p class="What_Used_Text">
        Imagine how difficult life would be if we did not have a way to control the database in this format. After
        getting a sense of what SQL is used for, let’s try our hands at learning SQL on an actual database.
    </p>

    <p class="Is_SQL">What Is SQL And How Does It Work:<span class="Learning_SQL"> Learning SQL With Some Basic SQL
            Commands </span> </p>

    <p class="We_Have_SQL">We have learned above what SQL is used for, so let’s try out each of these things on a real dataset. As an
        example, we have chosen a database of customers at an e-commerce store. This is what it looks like this:</p>

        <img src="Imagens/SQL_Stores.png" class="Image_SQL_Stores" alt="">

        <p class="Here_SQL">Here are some commands that we will be learning about, and later practicing as well.
            Command and description:</p>

        <p class="Create">CREATE <br><span class="Text_Create">Creates a new table, a view of a table, or another object in the database.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Alter">ALTER <br><span class="Text_Alter">Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Drop">DROP <br><span class="Text_Drop">Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other objects in the database.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Select">SELECT <br><span class="Text_Select">Retrieves certain records from one or more tables.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Insert">INSERT <br><span class="Text_Insert">Creates a record.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Update">UPDATE <br><span class="Text_Update">Modifies a record.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Delete">DELETE <br><span class="Text_Delete">Deletes a record.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Grant">GRANT <br><span class="Text_Grant">Gives a privilege to users.<br></span></p>
        <p class="Revoke">REVOKE <br><span class="Text_Revoke">Takes back privileges granted from users.</span></p>


        <p class="Commands_SQL">If you notice, the commands ‘create, alter & drop’ define the complete structure of data. They come under the ‘Data Definition Language’ set of commands. Similarly, ‘select, insert, update, delete’ fall under Data Manipulation Language & ‘grant, revoke’</p>
