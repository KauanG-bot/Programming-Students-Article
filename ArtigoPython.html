            The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in
            Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but
            pandas is the backbone of most data projects.

    <p class="TextPandas">
        Pandas has so many uses that it might make sense to list the things it can't do instead of what it can do. This
        tool is essentially your data's home. Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning,
        transforming, and analyzing it.

        How does pandas fit into the data science toolkit?

        Not only is the pandas library a central component of the data science toolkit but it is used in conjunction
        with other libraries in that collection.Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, meaning a lot of the
        structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in
        SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.Jupyter Notebooks
        offer a good environment for using pandas to do data exploration and modeling, but pandas can also be used in
        text editors just as easily. It give us the ability to execute code in a particular cell as opposed to running
        the entire file. This saves a lot of time when working with large datasets and complex transformations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Notebooks also provide an easy way to visualize pandas DataFrames and plots. As a matter of fact, this article
        was created entirely in a Jupyter Notebook.

        Reading Data into Pandas DataFrames
    </p>
    <p class="TextReading">
        Pandas offers a lot of functionality for reading different data types into DataFrames. For example, you can read
        data from Excel files, text files (like CSV), SQL databases, web APIs stored in JSON data, and even directly
        from webpages!
        Let’s take a look at how we can load a CSV file. pandas provides the option of loading the dataset either as a
        file stored on your computer or as a file it can download from a webpage. Take a look at the dataset here. You
        can either download it or work with it as the webpage (though, you’ll need an active internet connection, of
        course).

<p class="pandas_when">When should you start using pandas?</p>
<img src="Imagens/livro_python.png" class="imagePythonLivro">
<p class="python-text">If you do not have any experience coding in Python, then you should stay away from learning pandas until you do. You don’t have to be at the level of the software engineer, but you should be adept at the basics, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, and iterations. Also, I’d also recommend familiarizing yourself with NumPy due to the similarities mentioned above.</p>
